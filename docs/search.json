    "text": "My academic journey began at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Potsdam, where my initial focus was on basketball. However, my I enjoyed math and took calculus in high school, which prompted me to take calculus my first semester. I continued my education at Clinton Community College near my hometown, Plattsburgh, NY, earning a Math/Science AS degree while finishing my basketball career. Returning to SUNY Potsdam, I pursued double majors in math and computer science, culminating in a BA degree in both disciplines. My academic journey progressed further with the completion of a MA degree in math. The entire math department and my advisor, Dr. Cornelia Yuen, were (and are) incredible. I obtained a solid background in measure theory, abstract algebra and linear algebra, and they opened my eyes to a lot of opportunities.\nDriven by a desire for applied knowledge, I found my passion in statistics, drawn by its rapid growth in sports and other fields. Joining the statistics PhD program at the University of Connecticut (UConn) felt like a full circle moment, rooted in my family ties to the area and years of watching basketball games. My dissertation research has been under the guidance of Dr. Dipak Dey in the statistics department at UConn and co-advisor Dr. Shariq Mohammed in the biostatistics department at Boston University. Our research resides in developing Bayesian approaches for simultaneous estimation and feature extraction applied to sparse, high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. Our proposed methods are aimed at conquering the curse of high-dimensionality and computational burden experienced in modeling complex data. Leveraging a computation-efficient Bayesian feature extraction method, we construct models locally at different time points, where coefficients represent specific locations. The Gaussian and Diffused-gamma (GD) prior, which has shrinkage and selection features, is employed at each local model.\nThe GD prior, acting as a Bayesian version of the penalized loss estimator, plays a pivotal role in our methodology. Through the MAP estimator of latent vector d, we establish a proportional relationship between the MAP estimator of beta and the penalized loss estimator. We apply our methods to electroencephalography (EEG) data, aiming to analyze electrical activity between brain locations over time and predict alcohol status. Our ongoing work focuses on refining and advancing our methods, contributing to the evolving landscape of statistical methodologies."
