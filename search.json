    "text": "My dedication to teaching and mentorship has been exemplified through the effort I have given to the different leadership roles I have held as a Graduate Assistant at the University of Connecticut. As the primary instructor, the feedback I have received from student evaluations supports my level of commitment to fostering growth in others while continually advancing myself. The one-on-one tutoring positions I have held showcased my capacity to build strong connections with students and elevated my capability of providing relatable examples tailored to the individual. My experience in these roles has refined my ability to communicate statistical concepts, enhancing my adaptability to diverse learning needs. Furthermore, I have increased proficiency in writing through the recommendation letters I have been asked to write for students. Beyond traditional teaching roles, I organized workshops introducing R to faculty and students from diverse disciplines, fostering a cross-disciplinary understanding of statistical tools.\n\nCourses - Primary Instructor\n\nIntroduction to Statistics (STAT1000Q)\n\nSummer 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer 2022\nFall 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2024\n\n\n\nElementary Concepts of Statistics (STAT1100Q)\n\nFall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Mathematical Statistics II (STAT3445Q)\n\nSpring 2022"

    "text": "My research interest resides in developing cutting-edge Bayesian methodologies to address high dimensional classification and optimization problems related to spatio-temporal data. Specifically, my focus is developing feature extraction and estimation methods, while accounting for the cross-sectional correlations frequently observed in spatio-temporal data. This involves exploring sparsity inducing prior distributions, investigating techniques to incorporate the spatio-temporal structure into the model.\nMy research seeks to provide theoretical understanding and practical tools for efficient modeling and inference in complex settings with novel application. I am intrigued with examining neuroimaging data to unravel functional connectivity patterns between distinct brain regions, contributing to the broader discourse on cognitive and behavioral states. My motivation lies in the critical public health concerns surrounding mental-related illnesses which can be address through neuroimaging analysis. Leveraging Bayesian feature extraction and estimation procedures, I am driven to develop accurate subject-level prediction approaches to predict early onset of mental-related illnesses.\nIn conclusion, with interests in Bayesian methodologies, high dimensional spatio-temporal data analysis, and their application in neuroimaging, my research aims to be at the forefront of innovative statistical techniques with real-world implications."

    "text": "My academic journey began at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Potsdam as a result of being recruited to be on the basketball team. I realized that Division III basketball was a large commitment, so I continued my education at Clinton Community College, earning a Math/Science AS degree while finishing my basketball career. Returning to SUNY Potsdam afterward, I pursued double majors in math and computer science, culminating in a BA degree in both disciplines. My academic journey progressed further with the completion of a MA degree in math. The entire math department and my advisor, Dr. Cornelia Yuen, were (and are) incredible. I obtained a solid background in measure theory, abstract algebra and linear algebra, and they opened my eyes to a lot of opportunities.\nDriven by a desire for applied knowledge, I found my passion in statistics, drawn by its rapid growth in sports and other fields. Joining the statistics PhD program at the University of Connecticut (UConn) felt like a full circle moment, rooted in my family ties to the area and years of watching basketball games. My dissertation research has been under the guidance of Dr. Dipak K. Dey in the statistics department at UConn and co-advisor Dr. Shariq Mohammed in the biostatistics department at Boston University. Our research involves developing Bayesian approaches for simultaneous estimation and feature extraction applied to sparse, high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. Our proposed methods are aimed at conquering the curse of high-dimensionality and computational burden experienced in modeling complex data. We apply our methods to electroencephalography (EEG) data, aiming to analyze electrical activity between brain locations over time and predict alcohol status. Our ongoing work focuses on refining and advancing our methods, contributing to the evolving landscape of statistical methodologies.\nIn my personal life, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. Whether it be traveling, attending live music, or playing games inside, time with family and friends is precious. Traveling to new places is one of my favorite things to do, especially new beaches and mountains. Sports have always been a major part of my life and are my biggest passion. I grew up playing basketball, baseball, soccer, football, and hockey. My favorite sports to watch are college basketball, professional football, and professional baseball. There is no better sporting event than college basketball March Madness, in my opinion. Go UConn Huskies!"
